Non XVM Mirror creation BATCH

There are two things you MUST change each time you use this:

set "gameVersion=1.10.0.0"
set "date=2020-08-03"

These are lines 6 and 7 as of 2020-08-15.

Pretty self explanatory.

The zips are made without the ‘versiondir’ macro, as we always need to update these things each patch. 
But if that isnt the case, I will update it.
Edit: There is a version of the batch that is using "versiondir" now. -elektro-


You also need to do this, with your 7zip exe: 
New Path C:\Program Files\7-Zip ( Or your 7-zip install location)
